Here we propose AM-2k (Animal Matting-2000), which contains 2,000 high-resolution real-world animal images from 20 categories along with their manually labelled alpha mattes. The Dataset is aimed to aid research efforts in the area of image matting and related topics.

The structure of the dataset AM-2k is as follows:

AM-2k
├── train
	├── original (the real-world natural images)
	├── mask (the high-resolution manually labelled ground truth)
	├── fg (the foregrounds generated by closed form method)
	├── bg (the backgrounds generated by closed form method)
├── validation
	├── original (the real-world natural images)
	├── mask (the high-resolution manually labelled ground truth)
	├── trimap (the trimap of the ground truth mask, used in evaluation)
├── am2k_split_category.json (a JSON file consisting of the  category of each image)
├── AM-2k_Release_Agreement.pdf (the dataset release agreement of AM-2k)
├── readme.txt (the readme and instructions)

The dataset is under MIT license.

All research documents and paper that uses the Dataset will need to acknowledge the use of the data by including an appropriate citation to the following:
